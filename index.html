                    <p class="grey">
                        The main objective of the project is to create an online book store, where the customer can
                        purchase books online through a web browser.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="grey">Problem Statement</h4>
                    <p class="grey">
                        The world has moved onto a digitalized stage, in this world everyone is busy and everything is
                        done
                        on the go. This rises a problem in the world of book lovers, people who need to feel the rough
                        texture of a paperback book in their hand to enjoy the read. They do not always have the time to
                        be able to visit a bookstore to get their books.
                        Additionally, in this modern world, people are depending on credit cards and online banking.
                        Scarecly
                        anyone carries cash with them, as many bookstores do not support credit card machines or have
                        faulty
                        lines.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="grey">Solution</h4>
                    <p class="grey">
                        The online book store is a web based project which is easy to maintain, scalable and ready to
                        run project which can be used by everyone and it does not require any educational level or
                        experience. The user can search for the desired book and later purchse it. Users will have to
                        register themselves to purchase. Customer will be able to purchase books from anywhere through a
                        web browser. This removes the time consuming task of planning and making the trip to the
                        bookstore.
                        Who would be able to turn down the offer of books coming at your doorstep?
